# GeeksHub Python Bootcamp

This page is a placeholder for GeeksHub Python bootcamp slides, reading materials and example code. The participants of the bootcamps will only be allowed to make changes to the material/source code through pull requests which will be reviewed by GeeksHub champions. If you have any feedback/suggestion, feel free to talk to us. The course contents and code examples are continously evolving, so our suggestion is to view online whenever you require.

Almost all slides will have code examples unless it is purely concepts. The examples can be downloaded by clicking "examples" in the title slide of each topic or you can view these examples in examples directory in repository.

1. Topics - This is no replacement to our live sessions. But this helps participants to recollect the concepts. There are examples, questions/quizzes and simple programs to solve. You should do all these without fail.
2. Programming Puzzles - These are puzzles that should be solved using few concepts in Python
3. Tools Projects - Develop a tool and this can span for a period of 2-3 weeks
4. Projects - Span across months and often done with fellow GeeksHub Champions

Over a period of time, we plan to add programming problems, design problems that are solved in bootcamps, try-it-yourself like open ended problems. You are free to use for your own personal use. For any commercial use, talk to us. We will be glad to help for a fee.

### GeeksHub Champions
