# GeeksHub Python Bootcamp

This page is a placeholder for GeeksHub Python bootcamp slides, reading materials and example code. The participants of the bootcamps will only be allowed to make changes to the material/source code through pull requests which will be reviewed. If you have any feedback/suggestion, feel free to talk to us. The course contents and code examples are continously evolving, so our suggestion is to view in online whenever you require.

Almost all slides will have code examples unless it is concepts. The examples can be downloaded by clicking "examples" in the title slide of each topic or check our repsitory.

Over a period of time, we plan to add programming problems, design problems that are solved in bootcamps, try-it-yourself like open ended problems. You are free to use for your own personal use. For any commercial use, talk to us. We will be glad to help for a fee.

The participants of the bootcamps are encouraged to use this website/page, challenge in the bootcamps for an efficient solution. Discussion with friends or fellow developers are absolutely fine.
