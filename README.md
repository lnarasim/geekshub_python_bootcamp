# GeeksHub Python Bootcamp

This page is a placeholder for GeeksHub Python bootcamp slides, reading materials and example code. The participants of the bootcamps will only be allowed to make changes to the material/source code through pull requests which will be reviewed by GeeksHub champions. If you have any feedback/suggestion, feel free to talk to us. The course contents and code examples are continously evolving, so our suggestion is to view online whenever you require.

Almost all slides will have code examples unless it is purely concepts. The examples can be downloaded by clicking "examples" in the title slide of each topic or you can view these examples in examples directory in repository.

Each topic will have
    1. Bullets - This is no replacement to our live sessions. But this helps participants to recollect the concepts
    2. Examples - These are examples that we used to make things easy to understand
    3. Exercises - These are exercises discussed in bootcamps. The partcipants are expected to do this in their free time (somehow do it)
    4. Programming Puzzles - These are puzzles that should be solved using few concepts in Python
    5. Tools Projects - Develop a tool and this can span for a period of 2-3 weeks
    6. Projects - Span across months and often done with fellow GeeksHub Champions

Over a period of time, we plan to add programming problems, design problems that are solved in bootcamps, try-it-yourself like open ended problems. You are free to use for your own personal use. For any commercial use, talk to us. We will be glad to help for a fee.

### GeeksHub Champions
The participants of the bootcamps are encouraged to use this website/page, challenge in the bootcamps for an efficient solution. Discussion with friends or fellow developers are absolutely fine.
