# GeeksHub Python Bootcamp
## Co-Creating Tomorrow

### What we do
A space to __reinvent__ ourselves. A group of passionate software guys congregate to transform their own future, every weekend. It is a Hub for Geeks - __software craftsmen of tomorrow__. Right from the first principle, interconnecting the dots, producing something at higher abstraction - either self or technology.

While our goal is to transform ourselves, the by-products are finding a job to do what you would love to do. The journey is simple but involved, fixed number of steps with each step getting increasingly complex and rewards as we break the complexity.

### How we do
This page is just to make our life look easy. Your life changes if you __do__ these slides, examples and puzzles. You __transform__ if you do what is __said__

Almost all slides will have code examples unless it is purely concepts. The examples can be downloaded by clicking "examples" in the title slide of each topic or you can view these examples in the repository.

## Methodology
__Problem Solving, DS & Algo, First Principles__

## Modes:
__Sessions, Solved Examples, Coding Quizzes, Tools Projects Creative Questioning and Projects__

## Technology: 
__Python, Software Development and Automation, Linux, Virtualization, Containers, Microservices, CI/CD, TDD, IT Automation, Git/GitHub and the likes__

# The Steps to __Transform__

Read our [__Good Ways of Working__](good_ways_of_working.md)

1. __[Bootcamp Areas](topics/topics.md)__ - We anchor our sessions based on these topics and this is no means the complete list. These topics evolve as technology world evoles. The first four parts are focussed on first principles which provides you a platform to tackle any specialization/project. So, the first four parts are very important so that you do well in specialization

    * [Python - Bootstrapping](topics/python_bootstrapping.md)
    * [Python - Little Further](topics/python_little_further.md)
    * Python - Intermediate
    * Python - Pythonic
    * Python - Data Science Exposition (Specialization)
    * Python - AI/ML Exposition (Specialization)
    * Python - Visualization (Specialization)
    * Python - Backend, Web Development (Specialization)

2. __[Programming Puzzles](programming_puzzles.md)__ - These are puzzles that should be solved using few concepts in Python
3. __[Tools Projects](tools_projects.md)__ - Develop a tool and this can span for a period of 2-3 weeks
4. __Projects__ - Span across months and often done with fellow GeeksHub Geeks. The projects are not listed here and exclusive to Geeks
