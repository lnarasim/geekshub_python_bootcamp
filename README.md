# GeeksHub Python Bootcamp
## Co-Creating Tomorrow

A space to reinvent ourselves. A group of passionate software guys congregate to transform their own future, every weekend. It is a Hub for Geeks - software craftsmen of tomorrow. Right from the first principle, interconnecting the dots, producing something at higher abstraction - either self or technology.

While our goal is to transform ourselves, the by-products are finding a job to do what you would love to do. The journey is simple but involved, fixed number of steps with each step getting increasingly complex and rewards as we break the complexity.

This page is just to make your life look easy. Your life changes if you read these slides, examples and puzzles. You __transform__ if you do what is __said__

Almost all slides will have code examples unless it is purely concepts. The examples can be downloaded by clicking "examples" in the title slide of each topic or you can view these examples in examples directory in repository.

1. [Topics](topics/topics.md) - This is no replacement to our live sessions. But this helps participants to recollect the concepts. There are examples, questions/quizzes and simple programs to solve. You should do all these without fail.
2. [Programming Puzzles](programming_puzzles.md) - These are puzzles that should be solved using few concepts in Python
3. [Tools Projects](tools_projects.md) - Develop a tool and this can span for a period of 2-3 weeks
4. Projects - Span across months and often done with fellow GeeksHub Champions

#### Modes:
##### __Topics, Examples, Quizzes, Tools Projects and Projects will grow over a period of time__
### Technology: 
##### __Python, Linux, Virtualization, Containers, Microservices, CI/CD, TDD and the likes__
