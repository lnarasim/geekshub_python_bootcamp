# Object Oriented
- It is a paradigm
- Solve problems by modeling objects and their relationships
- Building OO software involves knowing the following.
    - OO Analysis
    - OO Design
    - OO Programming

---

# What is OO?
- Solving problem by decomposing as objects.
- Object has certain properties/attributes
- Object has certain functionalities/behaviors
- Example: A human being has nose, ear, mouth and performs breath, hear and speak (or eat)
- Specific way to model a solution
- It is a programming paradigm

---

# Classes
- Classes are center of OOP
- Classes are blueprint or template of objects
- Object is born out of classes
- A class has a name
- A class defines an object
    - properties/attributes
    - methods

---

# Object
- Is a thing
- Has an identity
- Attributes (that defines the state of the object)
- Behavior (that changes the state of the object)
- Not restricted to Physical items such as Car, Wheels or visible items like Apple, Eye, Body
- Any concepts can be an object
- Usually a noun is an object, the thing that you can add "The" before it like "The Event", "The Bank Account", "The Match", "The Score" and so on

---

# Abstraction
- Focus on essential qualities
- Leaving unimportant and irrelevant details
- A customer object of restaurant application need not generally worry on the kind of car she has
- A mechanic who changes the tyre of a car need not worry on how air-conditioning in car works

---

# Encapsulation
- Surround something
- Keeps the content intact
- Protect the content
- Restrict the access
    - Ex: Medicine capsule
    - Helps changing the implementation with breaking the interface
    - Encapsulation is not do with keeping your idea secret but to reduce dependencies amongst different parts of the software
    - Change in one part of the software does not cascade to others parts.
    - Ex: If I change the car's tyre should not force me to change the engine for the car to function.

---

# Inheritance
- Code Reuse
- Ex: Person, Employee, Father, Customer
- Super Class - Sub Class, Parent Class - Child Class

---

# Polymorphism
- Many forms
- "+" adds integers, concatenates string
- Overriding

---

# Relationships
- "is-a" relation
- "has-a" relation

---

# Exercises

1. Take a real world scenario such as parent, child, human beings, hands, legs, walk, eat etc and model them as objects and classes

2. Write class diagrams to model a simple address book that can store contacts (like you have one in your mobile phone)

3. Design a simple Bookmark manager to store/manage various links/websites
