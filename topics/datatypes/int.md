# Numbers
* Integers (int)
* Rational numbers (Fractions)
* Real numbers (float or decimal)
* Complex numbers (complex)

---

# Integral types
* int
* float
* bool
* fractions
* decimal
* complex
* bool - True or False

---

# Integer - General discussion
* Whole numbers (postive and negative)
   - signed
   - unsigned
* How numbers are stored
   - 8 bit notation
   - Sign bit
   - 7 bits sequence
   - (-128) to 127

---

# Integers in Python
* Integer is an object
* Immutable
* Unlimited in size
      * Can be as big as the size of the memory we have
      * Variable number of bits
* Seamless to us
* It has overhead
* Large number uses more memory
* Really large numbers take time to perform mathematical operations

---
# Integer airthmetic operations
* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division
* Floor Division [(a = b * a // b) + a % b]
* Modulo [(a = b * a // b) + a % b]
* Exponent (or raised to the power)

---
# Some Math functions
* math.trunc()
* math.floor()
* Floor division vs math.trunc vs math.floor
* divmod
* bin, oct and hex

---

# Integer Instantiation
* a = 10
* a = int(10)
* a = int('10')
* a = int(10.1)
* a = int('a', 16) # a base of 16
   * Base can be 2 to 36 (0 to 9, A to Z)
* a = int(True)
* a = int(False)

# Exercises (Cntd)

1. Define a whole number (integer) and print it

2. Define an integer and print the type of the integer using "type" function

3. Define a variable pi and assign the value of pi. Print the value of pi (pi is a floating poing number)

4. Write a program that prints area and circumference of a circle for a given radius (try it having radius as integer and floating point)

5. Define pi and print the type of 'pi'

6. Write a program to perform the following operations. Store the resultant value in a variable and print the variable with some meaningful text. For example, assign first = 2, second = 3 and print "2 + 3 = 5"
   - Addition (2 + 3 = 5)
   - Subtraction (3 - 5 = -2)
   - Multiplication (2 * 3 = 6)
   - Division
   - Floor Division
   - Exponent or raised to the power
   - Modulus

# Exercises (Cntd)

7. Take two very large number (probably 20 digits) and multiply both of them. Print the result.

8. Take one large number and one smaller number and perform raised to the power. Observe the behavior by printing the result.

9. Write a program to find whether a number is a multiple of 5

10. Write a program to find whether a number is a multiple of both 5 and 9

11. Assign a numerical value to a variable. Perform increment and print the value. Perform decrement and print the value.

12. Perform the following operations using the functions given. Read about these functions using help.
      - abs
      - round

# Exercises (Cntd)

13. Perform the following operators on integers and floating point numbers and print the result of evaluation (Note: either one of "True" or "False" should be printed. True or False is boolean values.)
      - 2 < 3
      - 2 > 3
      - 2 >= 3
      - 2 <= 3
      - 2 != 3
      - 2 == 3

14. Convert the following strings to int type using "int" functions. This is called as casting.
      - "2"
      - "100"
      - "-100"

15. Repeat the previous problem to float using "float" function.

16. Given a number "N", write a function to find sum of squares of numbers from 1 to N

17. How many digits does 3 ** 1000000 have? Write a program to find the number of digits

---

# Exercises (Cntd)

18. Type the following code in your Python shell, find out the output
      ```python
      import math

      print(math.pi)
      print(math.sqrt(4))
      ```

19. Write a program to generate a random number between 1 and 100
