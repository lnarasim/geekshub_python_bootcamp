# Tuples in Python
- Immutable
- Iterable
- Same as lists but immutable
- Defined using parentheses. Ex: ('India', 'USA')
- Indexing
- Slicing
- Executes faster than lists
- Define one item tuple as ("string",) as Python understands that as different data type

# Tuples - Packing and Unpacking

- Packing
```python
    >>> s1 = "hello"
    >>> s2 = "world"
    >>> s3 = (s1, s2)
    >>> print(s3)
    ('hello', 'world')
```
- Unpacking
```python
    >>> (p, q) = s3
    >>> p
    'hello'
    >>> q
    'world'
    >>>
```
