# Tuples in Python
* Container
* Ordered (Order matters), position has meaning
* Heterogenous
- Immutable
- Iterable
- Same as lists but immutable
- Defined using comma. Ex: 'India', 'USA'
- Supports Indexing
- Supports Slicing
- Executes faster than lists
- Define one item tuple as ("string",) as Python understands that as different data type

# Tuples - Packing and Unpacking

- Packing
```python
    >>> s1 = "hello"
    >>> s2 = "world"
    >>> s3 = (s1, s2)
    >>> print(s3)
    ('hello', 'world')
```
- Unpacking
```python
    >>> (p, q) = s3
    >>> p
    'hello'
    >>> q
    'world'
    >>>
```

# Immutability of Tuple
* Elements cannot be added or removed from Tuple after creation
* Order of elements cannot be changed
* Works well for representing data structure, data record

# Extracting Data
* Indexing
* Slicing
* Unpacking
* Iterating

# Exercises

1. Define a tuple and print the values

2. Perform all the exercises/problems on tuple that you did on lists

3. What is your inference/learning on tuple?
