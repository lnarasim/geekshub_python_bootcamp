# Callables
* Anything that can be called
* Callables always return a value
* Implicitly __None__ when no return value is specified
* Built in funtion __callable__ to find whether an object is callable

---

# Callables - Example
* Built in funtion callable
    ```python
    callable(print)
    callable('Hello'.upper)
    callable('str.upper)
    callable(callable)
    callable(1000)
    callable(list)
    callable(Myclass)
    ```

---

# Different Types of Callables
* built-in functions and methods
* user defined functions and methods
* All classes are callables
* Objects can be callables if \_\_call\_\_ is implemented
* Generators, coroutines, lambda, async generators
