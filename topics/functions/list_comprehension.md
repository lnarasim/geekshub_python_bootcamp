# Exercises

1. Get a list of squares of numbers from 1 to 50

2. A list contains tuples of (x, y). For all pairs of (x, y) in the list, find the corresponding list satisfying the following equations. Perform this using normal function and lambda.
    * x + y
    * 2x + 3y
    * 8x -9y

3. Given a string, write a function to get list of length of words.

4. Give a list of numbers, find logarithm of each number

5. Given a list of numbers, find the square root of each number

6. Given a list of strings, get the list of palindromes in the list

7. Given a list of numbers, get the list of numbers that are divisble by 3 and divisble by 7

8. Repeat all the exercises using normal named functions and lambda
