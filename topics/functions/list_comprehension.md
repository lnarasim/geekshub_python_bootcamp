# List Comprehension
* Create a list
* Conditions
* Evaluvate an expression
* Use lambdas
* Syntax:
    * lst = [expression for varname in iterable]
    * lst = [expression for varname in iterable if condition is true]

# Exercises

1. Get a list of squares of numbers from 1 to 50

2. A list contains tuples of (x, y). For all pairs of (x, y) in the list, find the corresponding list satisfying the following equations. Perform this using normal function and lambda.
    * x + y
    * 2x + 3y
    * 8x -9y

3. Given a string, write a function to get list of length of words.

4. Give a list of numbers, find logarithm of each number

5. Given a list of numbers, find the square root of each number

6. Given a list of strings, get the list of palindromes in the list

7. Given a list of numbers, get the list of numbers that are divisble by 3 and divisble by 7

8. Repeat all the exercises using normal named functions and lambda

9. Given a string, get a list of ASCII values

10. Given a list of ASCII values, get the string (not just list of individual characters)

11. Given a list of URL, get the list of active links (meaning the response should be 200 OK)

12. Given a list of Server IP Address, get the list of server that are responding to ping command

13. A list has various objects of different types. Write a list comprehension for the following
    * list of ints
    * list of floats
    * list of strings
    * list of tuple

# Exercises (cntd)

14. Write a list comprehension to find list of prime numbers between 2 and 100.

15. Write using nested list comprehension

16. Given the lengths and breadths of the rectangle as lists, write a list comprehension to find areas of the rectangle
    * Input: lengths = [2, 4, 5, 6] and breadths = [5, 6, 7, 8]
    * Output: areas = [10, 24, 35, 48]

17. Given the bases and heights of the triangle, write a list comprehension to find the areas of the triangles.
    * Inputs: bases = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and heights = [6, 8, 9, 20, 30]
    * Output: areas = [3, 8, 13.5, 40, 75]

# Exercises (cntd)

18. Given a list of positive integers, write a program that returns a list of prime numbers that comes immediately after the numbers
    * Input: numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    * Output: next_primes = [3, 5, 5, 7, 7]

19. __Revise this after two weeks__
