# GeeksHub - Python Bootcamp

This is the home page of our Python/Cloud Bootcamp. If you want to be a full stack/backend/cloud developer, read further and find out ways to acquire skills that matter most. Our bootcamps spreads over 4-5 months and inline with your weekday commitment. We give a lot of emphasis on understanding the system, applying first principles and problem solving. After going through one of our bootcamps, you will get expertise to solve any problems in any technologies.
